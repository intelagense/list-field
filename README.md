# list-field
Public training ground for coding challenges. 

## What is the purpose?
Each direct child directory of root reprensents a different area of study. To prevent spoiling, advanced coding challenge solutions and directories are exempted from upload via inclusion in `.gitignore`

### Directory tree
```
root/
├─ codewars/
│  └─ 8kyu/
│     ├─ JavaScript/
│     └─ C++/
├─ leetCode/
└─ README.md //You are here
```

## Tech Used
This files presented in this repo were built using:

* VSCode
* Vim
* Sandbox editors
* And of course `Ctrl + C && Ctrl + V`

## Optimizations
Future improvements could include:

* Scripting to automate the process of uploading and titling files.
* Including searchable site tags as comments in each coding challenge file.

## Lessons Learned
Working on coding challenges is a great morning exercise and habit. Having searchable access to a personal repo consisting of real world examples of previously written code can be useful for referencing syntax, functions, and methods.
