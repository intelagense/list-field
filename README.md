# list-field
Public training ground for coding challenges and personal snippits. 

## What is the purpose?
Each direct child directory of root represents a different area of study or testing. Code that is not quite useful enough to share can survive here. It is mainly for my future personal reference. 

### Directory tree
```
root/
├── cssbattle.dev/play (my (non highest score) cssbattle solutions)
├── scripts/ (bash scripts)
└── README.md (You are here.)
```

## Tech Used
This files presented in this repo were built using:

* VSCode
* Vim
* Sandbox editors
* And of course `Ctrl + C && Ctrl + V`

## Optimizations
Future improvements could include:
Better workflow using Gists.
More descriptive file names.

## Lessons Learned
Working on coding challenges is a great morning exercise and habit. Having searchable access to a personal repo consisting of real world examples of previously written code can be useful for referencing syntax, functions, and methods.
