# Solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems

These folders will contain solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems in a number of languages. Solutions are expected to be optimized and should explain how they were achieved. Often the source code of a solution is not published alongside the problem statement, making it hard for others to learn from it. My goal is to archive my progress while providing concise explanations.

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a series of challenging math problems you can use as a way to learn new languages.
