# Solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems

These folders will contain my solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems in a number of languages. 

My rules for each language:
1. 20 minute time limit per day
1. First run-through is for correct, suboptimal, solutions
1. Second run-through solutions will return the correct value in under 60000ms (Project Euler recommendation.)

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a series of challenging math problems you can use as a way to learn new languages.
